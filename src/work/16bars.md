<h2><i>{{title}}</i>, {{workYear}}</h2>

With sound artist *t l h* I was commissioned to produce a tape inspired work
that explored songlines within city woodlands. The final work, 16-bars, was
part of a larger piece by artist [Esther May
Campbell](https://esthermaycampbell.com/), for her Anything Moving and What
Remains work at the [MayK](https://www.mayk.org.uk/mayfest-archive/mayfest-2024) festival.
