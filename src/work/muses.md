## *{{title}}*, {{workYear}}

Muses was an umbrella project for work being done in the [Expressive Computer Interactions Group](https://www.uwe.ac.uk/research/centres-and-groups/csrc/research-themes/expressive-computer-interactions) at University of West of England (UWE). Our particular focus is applying programming language theory and practice, physical computing, networking, and musicial theory to design and implementation of Digitial Musical Instruments (DMI).
